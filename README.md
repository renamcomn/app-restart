# ADVANCED APP DESIGN
- The main goal of this mini-project is to inspire you on what we can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework.

# COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES
- We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Appleâ€™s stock user interface library.

# PARALLAX EFFECT
- By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect), we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.

# STORAGE
- Using app storage to restart the iPhone application
